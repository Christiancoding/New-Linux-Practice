    "explanation": "`grub2-install` installs the GRUB2 bootloader files to the appropriate location and typically installs the boot code to the MBR or EFI partition. Example: `grub2-install /dev/sda` (for BIOS systems) or `grub2-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi` (for UEFI systems)."

    "category": "Commands (System Management)",
    "explanation": "`mkinitrd` creates an initial RAM disk (initrd) image, which contains necessary drivers and utilities needed early in the Linux boot process before the root filesystem is mounted. Example: `mkinitrd /boot/initrd-$(uname -r).img $(uname -r)`"

    "question": "A system administrator notices that a production server is experiencing significant slowdowns. Upon further investigation using the top command, it's observed that the I/O wait percentage is consistently above 30%. Considering that the server's disk activity is not excessively high, what could be a probable cause for the high I/O wait?",
    "options": [
      "The hard drive is failing, causing read/write operations to take longer than usual.",
      "A misconfigured network firewall is limiting incoming connections.",
      "The I/O scheduler is configured for a single-threaded process, leading to a bottleneck.",
      "Insufficient memory available for buffer/cache leading to frequent disk access."
    ],
    "correct_answer_index": 3,
    "category": "Troubleshooting",
    "explanation": "Having insufficient memory available for buffer/cache can lead to high I/O wait times because the system has to commit to disk I/O more frequently than if it had enough memory to cache operations. This leads to higher wait times as processes are queued while the I/O bottleneck is resolved. Optimizing memory usage or adding more memory can help reduce I/O wait times. A failing hard drive or misconfigured I/O scheduler may also cause increased I/O wait, but these options are less likely if disk activity is not high and the hardware was previously functioning correctly."

    "question": "A system administrator needs to obtain information about which server versions are running on open ports of a remote host. However, the administrator must avoid performing an intrusive scan that could disrupt network services. Which of the following commands should the administrator run to best meet these requirements?",
    "options": [
      "nmap -sV --version-light target_host",
      "nmap -A target_host",
      "nmap -sT --top-ports=10 target_host",
      "nmap --top-ports=100 -sV target_host"
    ],
    "correct_answer_index": 0,
    "category": "Troubleshooting",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is nmap -sV --version-light target_host because this command line option tells Nmap to perform a service/version detection scan (-sV) using a light intensity, which is less intrusive and less likely to cause disruptions (--version-light). On the other hand, -sT performs a Connect scan that could potentially be more disruptive by completing the TCP three-way handshake; -A aggressively performs OS detection, script scanning, and traceroute, which is more intrusive; and --top-ports does not specify the intensity for version scanning and is primarily used for scanning a certain number of the most common ports."
